Essays are juxtaposed with a graph navigation that allows the user to browse the paintings, prints, drawings and clothes in the collection. Instead of showing the collection in its entirety, it is accessible through a curated selection of essays designed to provide a better understanding of it, combining editorial approaches with free exploration and user-driven granularity.",
