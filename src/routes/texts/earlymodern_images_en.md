# Dress and Manners in Early Modern Depictions

## Hans Burgkmair’s Peoples of Afrika and India (1508)
In his book, Hans Burkmair describes the inhabitants of the coasts of Africa and India. As in other early modern encyclopaedic descriptions, the distinction between Asia and North America/South America is not obvious from the start. The newly discovered peoples and their customs were often not properly classified. People with feather headdresses, for example, actually from the Brazilian tribe of the Tupinamba, were often used as a representative for the new foreign peoples.

Burgkmair, unlike other authors, said goodbye to the stereotypes that had arisen quite early. He depicts the people in a recognisable family context, their bodies are proportionally modelled and borrow from the artistic vocabulary of the Italian Renaissance. [Leitch 2010, 64]
