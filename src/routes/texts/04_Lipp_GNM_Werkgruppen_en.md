description: "Examples are used to introduce sujets, e.g. the portrait of Anne, Queen of England, illustrating the symbolic significance of dress and jewellery. In miniature painting, the so-called interchangeable portrait, consisting of differently painted transparencies, was a popular subject in the courtly context of the 17th century. Depictions of the five senses gustus, odoratus, visus, auditus and tactus with accompanying attributes are represented extensively in the Lipperheide collection and have been a popular motif since the 16th century. Fashion caricatures and moral mockeries are a special genre. Their informational content differs from other forms of pictorial representation. Finally, early vests, an 18th-century silk dress and waistcoats and frocks in 18th-century men's fashion are presented in their three-dimensional form and in painted reality."

# Portrait as staging 
## Political proclamation
The [Portrait of Anne, Queen of England](item/306) is among the depictions that enable the sitter to be clearly identified by her (garment) jewellery. The collar draws the eye to the jewellery elements attached to it: two monogram jewels attached to the collar by means of red silk bows. A crowned monogram jewel in the shape of a ["C4"](media/56281), consisting of set gemstones, is attached to the left edge of the collar. The right edge of the collar is adorned with a piece of jewellery in the shape of a crowned ["S"](media/56282). On her left breast, the sitter wears a medallion set with gemstones, also fastened with a red bow. Like clothing, jewellery can be read as a painted system of references: Jewellery linked the individual to a social group and allowed him/her to set him/herself apart from it. Jewellery monograms, portrait pendants and medal jewels sent political messages to the viewer and referred to alliances, claims and affiliations. 

The sitter's jewellery identifies her as [Anna, Queen of England](item/9428). Anna, formerly Princess of Denmark, grew up as the second daughter of King Frederik II of Denmark (1534-1588) and his wife Sofie of Mecklenburg-Güstrow (1577-1631) together with her brother Christan IV (1577-1648) in the prosperous Kingdom of Denmark. On 20 August 1589, at the age of 15, Anna was married to James IV, King of Scotland and subsequently [James I, King of England and Ireland](item/49314) according to the Lutheran rite in Denmark and moved to Scotland the following year for the next 13 years. In 1603, she and her husband travelled to London for the enthronement. The monogram jewels ["C4"](media/56281) and ["S"](media/56282) refer to her brother, Christian IV, and her mother, Sofie of Mecklenburg. The jewellery here becomes a multi-layered source of information: the monogram jewels not only identify the sitter as Anne, Queen of England, but also refer to her close personal and political ties to her mother Sofie and her brother Christian.

The garments depicted are by nature just as iconologically charged. Anne inherited a style of representation that was characterised by the powerful ruler, Elizabeth I, and a strong visual tradition. The Stuart collar, a variation on the Medici collar, had been introduced to the English court by Queen Elizabeth I. Anne followed in her footsteps and adopted a style of dress to ensure the continuity of the visual tradition. The hoop skirt variation, which was worn in the years between 1590 and 1600 and can be seen in a portrait of Elizabeth I, the so-called [Ditchley portrait](https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw02079/Queen-Elizabeth-I-The-Ditchley-portrait?search=sp&sText=Ditchley-Porträt&firstRun=true&rNo=0), had already been replaced in fashion during Anna's reign. In continuation of the courtly dress tradition, however, Anne had herself portrayed wearing this type of hoop skirt.

To summarise, the iconological level of meaning of the jewellery, which underlines the royal motto *La mia grandezza dal eccelso*, can be described as follows: The Christian layer of the confession of faith is taken up by the jewellery in the shape of a cross. The dynastic and personal level is represented by the monogram jewellery. The third dimension of meaning is the moral dimension, which is represented in portraits of Anna by jewellery in the shape of a crossbow, for example. In the picture-filling presence and the vestimental opulence of the sitter, the portrait of Anne is part of a pictorial tradition that Elizabeth I had introduced.

The full-length portraits by Paul van Somer (ca. 1576-1621) and his workshop, such as the *[Portrait](item/45250)* from the Royal Collections Trust London, can be seen as a model for other bust portraits created by his successors. He created these for the English royal family between around 1617 and 1618. The Berlin painting refers stylistically to Paul van Somer or his workshop.

## Interchangeable portraits in miniature format
The oval miniature portrait of a *[Woman with lace décolleté and pearl necklace](item/464)* shows a young woman in bust format, facing left. The red, puffy, low-cut dress is lined with a lace collar. A pearl necklace fits snugly around her neck and a bonnet ties her hair into a bun at the back of her head. The decidedly simple image of the young woman was part of a so-called *interchangeable portrait*, a phenomenon found in the courtly context of the 17th century. Painted transparencies were applied to the image and the different motifs on the transparencies changed the identity of the sitter: A young woman could become a young man with a moustache, ruff and hat, a nun in a nun's habit, a lady with a lion's head, a masked elegant lady, an oriental or a pirate, as the [specimen from the Garnermuseum](https://www.gardnermuseum.org/experience/collection/15800) shows. The woman changed in the same way as the foils, of which up to 23 different pieces have survived.

The type of woman in this variation of interchangeable portraits developed over time, as Evelyn Ackermann showed in the essay *Costume is the Key. Seventeenth Century Miniature Portraits with Overlays*[^Ackerman 2007]. Due to their timelessness, the simple portraits were particularly suitable for this game of transformation. The approximately 25 different surviving female portraits with overlays are contrasted with around 17 to 20 male portraits with corresponding interchangeable overlays. The most frequently surviving interchangeable portrait of a man was the miniature portrait of [Charles I, King of England, Scotland and Ireland (1600-1649)](item/9389). The Royal Collection Trust owns a [portrait of Charles I with a total of 12 interchangeable portraits](https://www.rct.uk/collection/422099/charles-i-1600-1649). While the identification of Charles I can be considered certain, the identity of the female portrait is still under debate; Ackerman argues that the lady who resembles the Lipperheide miniature is [Henrietta Maria, Queen of England, Scotland and Ireland](item/45244) and wife of Charles I. This theory is supported on the one hand by a comparable portrait, the [Picture of Henrietta Maria](https://www.rct.uk/collection/422348/set-of-mica-overlays-and-miniature-of-henrietta-maria-1609-1669) from the Royal Collections Trust, and on the other hand by a number of royal attributes on the interchangeable foils, such as the ermine fur. For this miniature portrait, Ackermann lists ten comparable miniatures from various collections [^Cf. Ackerman 2007, figs. 1-6 and 7-11. According to Ackermann and Sandra L. Rosenbaum, the depictions of the accessories and fashionable elements are also derived from the engraving series "Ornatus Muliebris Anglicanus" (1638-1640) by Wenzel Hollar]. In her essay *Seventeenth Century Miniature Portraits with Costume Overlays*, Sandra L. Rosenbaum refers to a miniature that shows the same dress elements [^Rosenbaum 2007, fig. 3].

Such metamorphoses borrowed their clothing elements from contemporary prints, such as the depictions by [Wenzel Hollar](item/9799). Here, for example, the headdress in the sheet [Mulier Coloniensis bonae qualitatis](https://hollar.library.utoronto.ca/islandora/object/hollar%3AHollar_k_1751) was the inspiration for a changing image with a similar appearance. Full-length portraits were also not uncommon.

# Allegory of the Five Senses
Like other cycles - for example the Four Continents or the Deadly Sins - the Five Senses became a popular allegorical subject in the 16th century, spreading mainly through Dutch prints. The five senses gustus, odoratus, visus, auditus and tactus are accompanied by animal symbols or attributes. The sense *Visus* is accompanied by the animals eagle, lynx, cat or owl or the attributes telescope, magnifying glass, spectacles or [mirror](item/10538). The sense of hearing (Auditus) is accompanied by a boar, a mole or deer or a musical instrument, usually the lute. The sense of smell (Oderatus) has as companion either a vulture or dog or as an attribute a [flower](item/10300), usually the [carnation](item/45235). Taste (Gustus), as in this example *[The Taste](item/538)*, is accompanied by a [monkey](item/10475) or represented with fruits, a fruit basket or with [wine glass](item/10431). As fifth sense is considered to be the sense of touch (tactus), which is accompanied either by a spider, a turtle, a scorpion or a [bird](item/10587) with a symbolic content, such as an [ornamental bird](item/583) pecking into the hand, or by a harp.
 
The Five Senses Cycle by [Cornelis Cort](item/45189), based on designs by Frans Floris (1561), led the way in its dissemination. In it, he combined two concepts that were already common in the Middle Ages: Female personifications of the senses endowed with attributes (significant objects) are accompanied by [symbolising sense-gifted animals](item/10587). Such pictorial cycles or individual scenes, in each of which one sense is singled out and interpreted as a symbol, were particularly popular. Similarly, allegorical representations of the five senses were created from the end of the 16th century onwards. For example, after 1587 Adam van Noort created the drawings for this [engraving](item/42994) in which the Five Senses are united on one sheet [^Allegory of the Five Senses, Adam van Noort (designer), Adriane Collaert (engraver), 1570-1618, copper engraving, 22 x 27.1 cm, Rijksmuseum (Amsterdam)]. A new realistic conception of the subject can also be discerned in an engraving executed by [Adriane Collaert](item/42994), with which the change from the original allegory to a bourgeois social image begins. Abraham Govaerts and Ambrosius Francken II (?) placed the [Allegory of the Five Senses](item/45736) from 1624 in a landscape setting.[^Landscape with the Allegory of the Five Senses, Abraham Govaerts, Ambrosius Francken II (?), 1624, Kunstpalast, Düsseldorf, Inv.-No. M 38]

The diversity of allegorical representations of the five senses, especially in Flemish and Dutch painting in the 17th century, produced large-scale allegories and small cabinet paintings. Cornelis de Vos, Adriaen van Ostade, Jan Miense Molenaer, Barent Fabritius, Ambrosius Francken the Younger and Herman van Aldewereld created such pictorial cycles.[^Cf. Fünf Sinne in der Malerei 2016]
French still life painting of the 1620s and 1630s also integrated the theme of the Five Senses. Furthermore, the biblical story of the Prodigal Son was interwoven with that of the Five Senses from the end of the 16th century, especially in the Netherlands. Scenes in inns with people playing music, drinking and smoking illustrate this. Painters such as Simon de Vos and David Teniers the Younger spread this pictorial theme. Another group of representations are the already mentioned narrative representations in the form of genre scenes: Until the 19th century, this type of painting, represented by artists such as Philip van Dijk, Luca Giordano, Gerard de Lairesse, Jacob Duck or Michiel Sweerts, was popular. The Lipperheide Collection includes a [painting](item/159) by [Joachim Creutzfelder](item/9350), which shows an unusual combination of the five senses with a family portrait.[^Cf. https://refa-essays.vercel.app/05_family_portrait_de].

# Mockery and moral messages
## Fashion caricature
The group of [fashion-critical prints](set/42017) represent a special genre of images with a specific informational value. Their messages are witty, sarcastic, sometimes concealed and difficult to decipher and sometimes explicit and supported by accompanying texts or statements placed in the subjects' mouths. The interpretation of caricatures is often speculative; fashion caricatures also involve the challenge of identifying the fashions depicted in terms of their regional and temporal characteristics, especially from the perspective of a mostly distorted representation [^Cf. Ridikül! 2003, pp. 33-35. Reading fashion caricatures must take into account the temporal context of their creation as well as the audience, and speculative interpretations should be compared with surviving written sources]. 
As both entertaining and serious contemporary documents, they not only provide information about the fashionable styles of the time, but also about social perceptions in relation to them. Fashion caricatures broaden our knowledge of how fashion was received, how it was evaluated by contemporaries, their attitude to ideals of beauty, the contemporary interpretation of political connotations, for example, and the fashion clientele itself. In addition, they also show a view towards contemporaries dressed according to the latest fashion, which varies from nation to nation. For example, wearers of courtly high hairstyles in the 1770s, as can be seen in the [Portrait of a Woman in a Dress and High Hairstyle](item/580), were accused of extravagance by the English, while French fashion critics criticised the dichotomy of *naturalness* and *affectedness*, or *morality versus immorality* [^Cf. Ridikül! 2003, p. 34].

## Pamphlets
In the 1620s, a genre of so-called [alamode sheets](set/48313) emerged, which were designed as pamphlets, usually anonymous and following a specific pattern, denouncing the rapid changes in fashion. The garments in focus were illustrated and named in text form. The German fashionable man of the early 17th century is described as "Der Aff thuts nach/ und meynt er treff es eben gut/", as the pamphlets on the [Teutschen Monsieur All'modo](set/68089) show. The focus was not only on the rapidly changing textile robes, but also on the exaggerated beard fashions that found their expression in the [variety of fashionable beards](set/56133) in the 17th century, which were circulated as pamphlets: the pamphlet [Gantz New eröffneter Bartkram, Darinnen 24. Sorten allerhand zierliche wolmundirte teutsch-Frantzösische vnd dieser Zeit gebräuchliche Bärte zu finden](item/56134) shows customers trying on the fake beards; a shorn poodle in the foreground can be read as a sign of vanity.

The following pamphlets depict the generational change and the accompanying change in values: on the one hand, the [Mockery of the old and new male and female costumes](item/48349), in which the fashionable and moral implications are discussed. On the other hand, the topic of the children's lack of love for their parents is also depicted through their fashionable appearance. The genre [Poor parents, rich children](item/10463) illustrates a lesson for rich citizens who have passed on their money all too generously to their children and have to ask them for support when they get older. The moral message is conveyed via the fashionable appearance: the splendid appearance of the younger generation is contrasted with the unfashionable and poor appearance of the parents, as shown in the painting [Poor Parents, Rich Children](item/348), the [Encounter with an Old Couple](item/17930), the [print with the same title](item/17924) by [Robert de Baudous](item/17784) or the anonymous [print with the same title](item/17927).

# Textile opulence: a robe à la francaise
## The dress style
The [light blue silk dress](item/19625), created in the mid-18th century and surviving without any alterations to the cut or fabric, is a fitted andrienne that was referred to as a *taille andrienne* in contemporary German encyclopaedias. It consists of around 12.5 metres of patterned silk fabric, the silk fabric has a width of 52.4 cm and an additional selvedge of 0.8 cm. The filigree flower patterns are not embroidered but woven in. The bodice, which is fitted at the front and has a partially closed group of pleats at the back - the typical feature of a *[robe à la française](set/48664)* - is tapered and open at the neckline. Over the long opening of the chest area, which is reinforced with chintz linen, a triangular, recessed bodice was originally worn. This bodice, which has not survived in the case of the blue dress, concealed the undergarment. It was attached to the dress neckline with pins. Both the centre front and centre back are stabilised with whalebone stays and lacing at the back allowed it to be adjusted to fit the wearer. A long linen shirt and a separate laced bodice were worn under the dress and bodice. The sleeves were smoothly set in and covered the arm up to the elbow, where they ended in so-called wing cuffs, French *manchettes à raquette* and informally known as *fin sleeves*. Like the sleeves, they are lined with linen and additionally stiffened with paper in the cuffs. White lace cuffs peeked out from underneath, as shown here in [Image](item/623), but these have not survived.

## Floral ornaments
18th century textiles reflect the taste of the time for gardens and individual flowers, such as roses. Floral ornaments, [flowers](item/10300) and blossoms were usually arranged loosely but symmetrically on the textile. The symbolic power of flowers played a major role in the occasion for which the dress was worn. In portraits, too, flowers such as the [carnation](item/45235) indicated an occasion, here usually a [wedding portrait](item/9693). In the case of the blue silk dress, the floral elements are woven into the fabric. A silk fabric of this kind with tendrils arranged in waves, flower garlands, bouquets and lace ribbons was one of the most popular fabric patterns designed and produced in a multitude of variations in all European centres of silk weaving between 1740 and 1775.
The spiral-shaped flowers of the dress fabric are based on the common jasmine *(Jasminum officinale)*, a climbing plant with fragrant petals. The bouquets contain, with variations in the details and foliage, a primrose hybrid of *Primula elatior* at the top, a rose and two rosebuds in the centre, and either a carnation or a peony *(Paeonia officinalis)* at the bottom.[^A similar example was found in a pattern book from 1764 in the Victoria & Albert Museum, London, which was published by Lesley Miller in 2014. The book was compiled in Lyon for the English market; this pattern on folio 33v is a silk satin with flower garlands, bouquets, lace ribbons and scattered flowers. See the exhibition catalogue Luxus in Seide 2018.]

## The undergarments
The cyclamen-red silk hoop skirt, French *[Jupe de baleine](http://objektkatalog.gnm.de/objekt/T8504)*, which entered the Germanisches Nationalmuseum along with the light-blue silk dress, is a wide, stiffened underskirt that formed the various dress silhouettes of the Rococo period. Roughly knee-length, the positioning of the row of hoops supports the weight of the overlying dress, especially in the hip area. The shaping of the silhouette by means of stiffened petticoats and in particular the resulting extraordinary volumes were the subject of ridicule and criticism. Countless [caricature prints](item/45219) and [lampoons or moral writings](item/45716) also contributed to the spread of this fashionable style. As early as 1740, the crinoline was figuratively [sent into exile](item/48668). In addition to the long linen shirt mentioned above, the wearer would have also worn a [pair of silk stockings similar to these ones](http://objektkatalog.gnm.de/objekt/T2602) and shoes with fairly flat heels. The padding of the hips had already been depicted in a caricature 100 years earlier: Created between 1580 and 1600, the depiction of *[The Vanity of Women](item/18030)* shows the padding of the hips with so-called hip pads and a corresponding voluminous garment.

## The Doublet in the 17th century
The term [doublet](set/56174) originally referred to an undergarment that was worn from the High Middle Ages as a protective layer under the breastplate, the so-called cuirass. Over time, the doublet became a buttoned-up body skirt with decorations. In the 14th and 15th centuries, the doublet had a close-fitting shape, a round neckline or stand-up collar. From the late 15th century onwards, the doublet could have a small lap, covering the base of the leggings. By the 16th century at the latest, it had become a pure outer garment with various decorations and designs. The popularity of the doublet increased even further in the 17th century. It was characterised by its long sleeves, an accentuated waist and a flared lap. The doublet was combined with lavish [ruffs](set/56178) and [cuffs](set/56179). A special feature of this outer garment were the interchangeable sleeves, which were connected by lacing or hooks to the so-called body under the shoulder pieces (‘shoulder flaps’). As a result, the doublet came to resemble the shape of the breastplate (cuirass), which was curved at the front and had a protruding lap. The [Plate armour for the foot tournament](item/19630) from 1591 shows such a shape, as do the breastplates in the following [pictorial representations](set/60183)."[^Cf. In Mode 2015, p.84 and p.101]

It was used for everyday wear as well as for festive occasions. The doublet was worn by both men and women. Examples include the [Portrait of a woman with ruff and beaded bonnet](item/502) from 1588, the [Portrait of a woman in a doublet and slit sleeves](item/566), or the [Portrait of Giulia Casale](item/401). The tall, stiff hat was also worn not only by men but also by women, as this [Portrait of a Woman with a Spanish Hat and Ruff](item/5103) shows. The engraver [Wenceslas Hollar](item/9799) dedicated several series to [Portraits of Women](item/5103) from different regions. The depictions of [The Woman with the Man's Hat](item/7765) and [The Wife of the Lord Major from London](item/7761) should be highlighted here. The gender assignment was based on the clothing for the lower body. The flat and strongly masculine doublet, worn by women, triggered an early criticism of clothing [^Cf. In Mode 2015, pp. 166-167, cat. nos. 87 and 88] Material and expense varied according to class and were specified in the dress code.

An early example is the [Doublet with slit pattern](item/56167) from the end of the 16th century. The appearance of the doublet is characterised by the padded front and back sections, the long and narrow sleeves, a central button fastening and a high stand-up collar. The slit pattern of the outer material is based on contemporary woven patterns.[^Cf. In Mode 2015, p.85]

The [Doublet with embroidered decorative stripes](item/19905), dating from 1630 to 1640, is characterised by a heavily textured surface, distinctive sleeves, a pleated lap at the back and a flowing silhouette. The red and yellow silk atlas as well as the blue and yellow embroidery threads have faded today, but still bear witness to the eye-catching colour of the past. Although the collar and lap of this doublet are still cut separately, they join the front and back parts seamlessly and without visible transitions. The embroidered decorative stripes have been placed over the seams. The shoulder pieces are joined together at the top edge with decorative stitching. The sleeves are wide and open at the front with buttons.[^Cf. In Mode 2015, p.101] This doublet underwent various changes over time. A ‘gusset’ (dt.: Zwickel) extending to the waist was introduced in the back. This consisted of at least three flaps folded open, which were removed from the shoulder of the doublet. The result of the adjustment was a more pronounced waistline in the back area, which also makes the lap appear bell-shaped. This indicates an adaptation to a woman's body.[^Cf. In Mode 2015, p.101]

This [doublet with slits](item/19898), dated 1650 to 1660, represents the last fashionable change to the doublet in the mid-17th century. It still has a stand-up collar, separately attached lapels and long sleeves. These are close-fitting on the lower arm, while the upper arm is slit and allows the shirt to show through. The [Portrait of Charles I, King of England, as Crown Prince](item/158) shows a comparable upper sleeve. The shape develops into a jacket, moving away from a waist-length garment. The lap lengthens, formed here by eight narrow strips that overlap slightly above the natural waistline. The lap has rows of holes to which the trouser parts were originally attached or tied. Here, the rows of holes have a purely decorative function.

In variation to the silk upper layer, velvet doublets have also come down to us, as shown in this [Portrait of a young man in a doublet, with a ruff and a flower in his hand](item/83) from the early 17th century. As these [examples](set/60147) show, patterns on the outer garments were either appliquéd or worked onto or into the material using a metal stamp (slit). Horizontal bands structured the outer material, often with [floral motifs](set/56222). Beneath a layer of taffeta was a woollen lining.[^Cf. Braun et al. 2016, pp.26-38]

The [doublet with slits](Item/19898) was made around 1630 to 1640 and is not preserved in its original condition. It underwent alterations in 1875 and from 1954 to 1957, when it was shown at historical fashion shows and was worn by actors. The outer layer is made of white silk satin with an embossed pattern of criss-crossing ribbons; it has inlays and reinforcements on the body, collar, sleeve slits and buttonhole placket. The doublet is decorated with slit arms that reveal the sleeves underneath, which are usually of a different colour, slits in the front and back of the upper part and sewn-on woven borders. The long, parallel slits can be attributed to French fashion and show a departure from the stiffer Spanish fashion. The number of slits or stripes could vary, as the french example of the [Portrait of Henri II de Montmorency](https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/P_1891-0414-159) or the sheet [La Noblesse de Lorraine](https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/nl/collectie/RP-P-OB-20.898) created by Jacques Callot from 1620 to 1623 show. The centre front was originally fastened with 23 buttons - now lost - in the style of these [examples](set/60107). The cut of the doublet is similar to its predecessors, but the waist sections are now reinforced with bents. These were covered with wool to ensure that the friction did not damage the surrounding fabric or the wearer. The doublet had two laces at the hips. The lacing brought the edges of the waist pieces together at the bottom and pressed them outwards. This effect was intensified when the doublet was buttoned up. This lent the doublet its pointed shape and made it look more like a cuirass than its predecessors. Eyelet holes are set into the waistband of the doublet; these were purely decorative. Decorative loops with so-called lace tips were attached to them, as shown in the [detailed view](media/60146) of the [[Portrait of Charles I](item/158). A decorative belt was worn over the lace tips at waist height, which was fastened to the eyelets at the lower end of the doublet. [^Cf. Braun et.al. 2016, pp. 112-124]

Another type of doublet can be seen in this [[Portrait of Hanns Winckler the Younger](item/49908) from around 1660. It is characterised by narrowing shoulder flaps which make for broad shoulders. It is cut from one piece and has a large number of buttons on the chest, similar to these [examples](set/60107). [^Cf. Costume & Fashion 2016, p.40]

## Waistcoats and frocks in 18th century men's fashion
Since the turning point in the history of men's clothing in Europe, which can be dated from around 1660 to 1665, men wore a new type of outer garment in the form of a knee-length lap skirt. It was inspired by the wide and loose cut of a soldier's coat. For civilian clothing, the cut was more closely orientated to the shape of the body (*justaucorps*, i.e. close to the body). In the 18th century, the [fashionable ensemble for men](item-set/60269) consisted of a jacket (frock coat), or *justaucorps*, waistcoat and breeches, also known as *culotte*.[^Cf. Kleiderwechsel 2002, pp.31-32] The example of a [frock coat](item/18851) from around 1695 shows knee-length outerwear. Until the beginning of the 18th century, this form of *justaucorps* had long laps at the front and was slightly flared at the lower back. Instead of a collar, the neckline was decorated with a neck tie, the shirt worn underneath was visible, the sleeves ended in wide cuffs and both vertical and horizontal pockets were attached to the lap. Visually, the waist slipped downwards due to the *justaucorps* being worn open in the chest area.[^Cf. Kleiderwechsel 2002, pp.31-32] The cut of the outer garment is comparable to that in the [Portrait of a gentleman in justaucorps with cloak and allonge wig](item/177) or in the [Portrait of a gentleman in justaucorps and tricorne hat under his arm](item/95).

An example of a waistcoat worn underneath is the [waistcoat](item/18844) associated to the *Justaucorps* made of blue silk patterned with metallic threads. The waistcoat is without sleeves or a collar, as this [example](item/265) also shows, and has a distinct waistline and flared lap parts. The lapels of the waistcoat and the *justaucorps* have slits for the [sword](item/10426) at the sides and in the centre back. These slits are lined to relieve the weight.[^Cf. Kleiderwechsel 2002, pp.31-32]

[Justaucorps](item/18851), [waistcoat](item/18844) and a [wig](http://objektkatalog.gnm.de/objekt/T1661_a) are part of a three-piece ensemble that was acquired for the textile collection of the Germanisches Nationalmuseum in 1879. A lost note, found in the waistcoat pocket during the acquisition, bore the inscription ‘from [Duke Friedrich II of Gotha](item/18852), who wore the clothes in 1696 and received a bullet wound in the chest from parading soldiers in Kramberg near Gotha’ and indeed the waistcoat and justaucorps each have a hole in the upper chest area. The [portrait of a Brandenburg elector](item/345) shows an ensemble with justaucorps, waistcoat and red stockings dating to the first quarter of the 18th century. The collarless *justaucorps* and coat are made of red fabric spun with gold threads (damask?). A rich floral pattern is set against a bright red background. Gold embroidery adorns the justaucops, the hem edges, pocket flaps and the wide cuffs. Gold-coloured fringing runs around the hem of the lapels and down the centre of the crotch. The crown in the lower left edge of the picture can be identified as an elector's hat due to the ermine-trimmed hoop, the pearl-trimmed temples and the golden imperial orb above the flat red cap.[^Cf. Johann Kupezky 2001, p. 196] The decorations also identify him as a member of the [Order of the Black Eagle](item/10686). The cross of the order, a blue Maltese cross, bears the initials FR for Fredericus Rex, i.e. Frederick the Great of Prussia, in the centre circle. It can be assumed that the elector depicted is [Karl Wilhelm Friedrich, Markgrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach](item/9442).
