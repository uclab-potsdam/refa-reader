# Early modern costume books in the Lipperheide Costume Library (Berlin)
Heinrich Doege, from 1899 assistant and later the first curator of the Lipperheide Costume Library, was the first fashion scholar to study, order and contextualize the early modern costume books from the Franz and Frieda von Lipperheide bequest. In 1903 he already noted that the variety that appeared in the field of costumes in the sixteenth century was extraordinarily great and extremely favorable to the emergence of a literature which sought to capture this wealth in pictures.[^Doege 1903] He explicitly mentioned the predecessors for Cesare Vecellios encyclopedic approach: costume prints, as well as drawn and painted costume books, dressmaker books and autograph books such as [Album Amicorum](41434), being very popular amongst german students studying in Italy in the 16th and 17th century. 
Of these costume books there are several outstanding examples in the Lipperheide costume library depicting universal costumes, such as [Sigmundt Heldt's](item/39055) *[Abconterfaittung allerlei Ordenspersonen (Nürnberg 1570?)](item/39072)*, the *[german Trachtenbuch (Augsburg?) from approximately 1580 to 1600](item/39082)*, a collection of images from various artists, or the watercolor images in the manuscript [Trachtenbuech. Darinen viller Volckher vund Nationen Claidung (Augsburg? 1580)](item/39076). Some of these examples are less well known and will be presented and discussed in the wider context of Franz von Lipperheides collection strategy, in which the compilation of fashion sources, comprised of pictorial evidence, text sources, secondary literature and textiles, is to be understood as a repository of knowledge as well as a methodological approach of an early costume historiography. 

# Dress and Manners in Early Modern Depictions

## Hans Burgkmair’s Peoples of Afrika and India (1508)
In his book, Hans Burkmair describes the inhabitants of the coasts of Africa and India. As in other early modern encyclopaedic descriptions, the distinction between Asia and North America/South America is not obvious from the start. The newly discovered peoples and their customs were often not properly classified. People with feather headdresses, for example, actually from the Brazilian tribe of the Tupinamba, were often used as a representative for the new foreign peoples.

Burgkmair, unlike other authors, said goodbye to the stereotypes that had arisen quite early. He depicts the people in a recognisable family context, their bodies are proportionally modelled and borrow from the artistic vocabulary of the Italian Renaissance. [Leitch 2010, 64]
