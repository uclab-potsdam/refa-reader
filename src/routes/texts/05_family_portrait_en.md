description: "The oil painting can be described and interpreted in multiple ways: At first glance, it shows three elegant young ladies and two gentlemen in a landscape. Each of the figures depicted is assigned an object, e.g. a bird or a mirror. These attributes refer to the five human senses - taste, smell, sight, hearing and touch - one of the most varied and appealing motifs in European painting. At the same time, the work is also a family portrait of five siblings of a family from the north-east of Baden-Württemberg, the former principality of the House of Hohenlohe. In addition, it depicts fashion from the time of the Thirty Years' War in Germany."

# Portrait of the Five Children of Count Philipp Ernst zu Hohenlohe-Langenburg as Allegory of the Five Senses
The [small-format painting in landscape format](item/159) shows [three women ](media/45744) and [two men](media/1628) standing in a landscape as an allegory of the five senses. The figures are standing on a narrow grassy hill, in the foreground, the three ladies on the left and two gentlemen on the right. The lady at the left edge of the picture is playing a mandolin. Next to her, facing the first lady, are the other two fashionable women. One holds a mirror in her right hand, the other lifts her upper garment slightly and is pecked in the finger by a green parrot sitting on her hand. Separated by a narrow path that meanders into the depths parallel to a river, the two gentlemen stand under the tree on the right. While the one, his back turned to the ladies, reaches into the tree for a red fruit with his left hand, the one standing next to him brings a blossom to his face with his right hand.

## Identification of the sitters
The [inventory card](media/1602) of another portrait in the collection, contains a cross-reference to the painting originally labelled *Five Senses* with anonymous authorship. The [inventory card](media/3777) states that the depiction of a young nobleman, labelled *[Junger Mann im Schoßwams](item/607)* and from an anonymous hand, bears a visual resemblance to one of the men depicted in the *Portrait of the Five Children of Count Philipp Ernst zu Hohenlohe-Langenburg*. 
By means of the numbers and letters scratched on the back - "1.6.4.7 Henry Fridezic Comte de Holax s"[^Fridezic alternatively Frideric; Holax alternatively Holar or Holac; free-standing s crossed out diagonally], which is visible in this [photography](media/3776), research led to the identity of the sitter.[^This research was carried out by Anne Leicht] The person portrayed is therefore Heinrich Friedrich zu Hohenlohe-Langenburg (1624-1699) [^cf. on the brothers Joachim Albrecht and Heinrich Friedrich Hohenlohe 1995, pp. 17-24, especially pp. 22-24]. Derived from other small-format paintings owned by the Hohenlohe family, not only the identity of the young man in the single Portrait, but also the identity of the five siblings in the Allegory of the Five Senses could be determined. Furthermore, a comparison of the material support of the individual portrait and the [Family Portrait](media/1560), shown here with ultraviolet light for better readability, led to the conclusion that the two works were created by the same artist. It is the court painter [Joachim Georg Creuzfelder](item/9350).

## The five senses
The present [family portrait](item/159) thus shows the five children of Count Philipp Ernst zu Hohenlohe-Langenburg with the attributes of the Five Senses [^Cf. https://github.com/uclab-potsdam/refa-reader/blob/essays/04_Lipp-GNM_Werkgruppen_de.md#allegorie-der-fünf-sinne]. From left to right are: [Eva Christina](item/9390) as *[Auditus](item/10613)* (hearing) with a lute, Anna Magdalena as *[Visus](item/10536)* (seeing) with a [mirror](item/10946), Maria Juliana as *[Tactus](item/10586)* (feeling) with a bird pecking at her hand, Joachim Albrecht as *[Gustus](item/10913)* (tasting) with an apple and [Heinrich Friedrich](item/607) as *[Odoratus](item/10550)* (smelling) with a flower. In this sibling portrait, the young Hohenlohe court painter combines the usual iconographic inventory of symbols of the allegory of the five senses with a family portrait. Creuzfelder chose a simple assignment of five sensory attributes to one portrait each, in which no biographically based pattern of assignment is discernible.
Another example of this mixture of genres can be seen here: In 1637, the sibling portrait of the [children of Duke Augustus the Younger of Brunswick-Lüneburg](item/43003) was painted at another German court. The children are depicted in an interior room, the open window providing a view of Brunswick Castle Square with the Brunswick Lion and the so-called "Mosthaus". From left to right are Rudolf August (1627-1704) as *Auditus* at the piano, Ferdinand Albrecht (1636-1687) with a parrot as *Tactus*, Sibylla Ursula (1629-1671) as *Visus* holding a mirror, Anton Ulrich (1633-1714) as *Gustus* with the attributes fruit basket, wine glass and monkey and Clara Augusta (1632-1700) as *Odoratus*, holding flowers in her hand and a dog. In contrast to the Hohenlohe painting, the iconography of the allegorical depiction is more complex and more than one attribute accompanies the children.

## Fashionable garments
The males in the depiction are dressed in a wide-flared, sleeveless leather buff-coat. The breeches are worn wide and are decorated with gold-coloured elements on the side. The wide-legged cup or gauntlet boots fall in soft creases, and spurs are attached to the bootstrap. The toes of the boots are angularly shaped. The ensemble is completed by decorative [braudiers](item/10426) and buckles. The hair falls open and curly over a turn-down collar made of lace. The headgear consists of a felt or woollen hat (beaver fur?) with a high stiff headpiece and a narrow brim. Around the hat is a gold-coloured corded string. 
The three ladies depicted wear floor-length dresses of richly and fully embroidered textile, moderately puffed by petticoats. The sleeves consist of a half-length sleeve and a long sleeve and fall stiffly. The waists are pushed upwards and the *snip toes* are moderately low. The décolletés are framed by flat, wide [lace collars](item/10427). The sitter's hair is tied in a knot, also called a *chignon*, above the ears and covered by a [small bonnet](item/10421). This hairstyle is accompanied by earrings in the form of single large pearls.

The present painting falls into the transitional period between the early Baroque, also marked by the time of the 30 Years War [1614-1648](set/48310), and the High Baroque. Whereas during the Renaissance fashions still varied greatly from region to region, from 1630 onwards an increasingly large part of Europe was covered by a uniform style of hairstyle and dress. The Thirty Years' War separated the two great courtly fashions, the [stiff Spanish fashion](set/48311) from the playful French fashion of the late Baroque under the fashion supremacy of [King Louis XI](item/9425).

During the 30 Years' War, men's fashion is strongly influenced by military clothing, which in turn was composed of the elements of peasant costume and had been adapted to the needs of the wearer. The basic elements consisted of a felt hat, a soft overskirt, an either [sleeveless or long sleeved leather buff-coat](set/45248) over the doublet, the bandelier, a leather strap laid over the shoulder that held the [rapier or sword](item/10290), as well as comfortable breeches and cup boots, also called gauntlet boots. The man's decorative accessories were the hat, lace-trimmed sleeve cuffs, the lace collar and the adornment of the cup boots with lace, as well as the braudier, metal fasteners and buckles and spurs.

At the courts of France and England at the time of the Thirty Years' War, the ideal of the cavalier emerged, who was characterised above all by courtly and gallant behaviour. The appearance of the cavalier in the so-called *cavalier fashion* is characterised by half-length, moderately wide-cut trousers, which replaced the tight-fitting leggings. The breeches were either tied or worn straight, at knee height and at the outer seams the textile was often decorated with metal threads or with nestels, later, at the time of the Rhine count's dress, with [ribbon jewellery](item/353) or rosettes. The legwear was supplemented by wide cup boots, which were sometimes filled out with lace. The front cap was no longer round but angular. 
The long sleeved buff-coat as a military garment had also found its way into the civilian context, its lap parts overlapping and taking up the wearer's movements as he stepped out. Abraham Bosse illustrates in his engraving [A gentleman](item/25436) the fashionable attributes of a french noblemamn. The broad-brimmed hat was often adorned with an ostrich feather, and the wide cup boots reinforced the wearer's striding out by swinging the textiles. This was acoustically underpinned by the metal accessories such as baudrier and spurs, which had also found their way into the civilian context. Curly hair and a cavalier's beard were further hallmarks of the cavalier. The attributes of cavalier dress were not only adopted, especially by the fashionable bourgeois, but were carried on to fashionable foppery. It was in this context that the term "à la mode cavalier" or ["monsieur à la mode"](set/48313) was first used in Germany and France.

In women's clothing, the hoop skirt has been replaced and the now less extreme widening of the hips is achieved by hip pads and by puffy petticoats. The wide, pleated skirt is usually overlong and gathered as one walks. In the front, a deep, stiffened snood descends into the lap. By bending slightly forward, it accentuated the midriff and the high waistline. 
The sleeves were puffy wide to club-shaped and puffed. After 1640, the sleeves became three-quarter-length and slightly tighter. The stiffened Spanish ruff was now replaced by a soft, rounded shoulder and a rounded neckline collar falling over the shoulder. The trend towards a softly falling collar can be observed in women's fashion just as in men's fashion around 1630.

In women's fashion, a simple hairstyle replaced the high Spanish women's wigs around 1620. The hair is now tightly tied from the forehead and over the ears with the hair at the nape of the neck to form a strong chignon, an elaborate interweaving in the form of a pinned-up knot. The twisted braids, sometimes supported by netting, sit high on the back of the head and are framed by strings of pearls. This hairstyle is very often accompanied by earrings in the form of single large pearls. Later, around 1640, more freedom was given to fringe and side curls; especially in women's fashion, this harmonised with the soft drape of the dresses. In contrast to the bourgeois women, whose hairstyle required a bonnet, aristocratic ladies were allowed to display their artfully drawn curls openly.
